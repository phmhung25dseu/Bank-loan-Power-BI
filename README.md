## I. Introduction

This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of loan data to uncover trends, regional variations, and the influence of employment duration on loan outcomes. A key objective is to distinguish between good and bad loans, supporting more accurate risk assessments.

Our primary goal is to support data-driven decision-making in loan approvals by building a robust reporting system and identifying critical performance indicators. Through this analysis, we aim to enhance the efficiency of the loan approval process, reduce risk exposure, and improve overall portfolio quality.
